## An offline GUI tool for base64 conversion

I was tired of watching people pasting their Kubernetes secrets on ad-bloated web pages, just for getting a base64 conversion.

And yes, I know. There is a simple command-line for that.

### Installation (macOS X)

  - Clone the repository.
  - Call `make`.
  - Copy the resulting app file from the dist folder into your Programs folder.
